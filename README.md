# 👋🏼 Hello! I'm Julio Cesar,
a 👨🏽‍💻 software and UI/UX developer with one year experience, a 👨🏽‍🎓 B.S. in Computer Science & Engineering from the University of California, Merced, and an additional 4+ years of 👷🏼‍♂️ CAD and engineering experience.

I've built software tools together with small businesses and large government organizations. Many of the initiatives on which I have worked, from conception to deployment, have involved the development of new ideas. I've created a variety of software tools, including an 👁 eye-controlled e-book reader, a native 📍 location-based iOS iPhone app, and web applications for organizations like 🚄 (BART) Bay Area Rapid Transit in San Francisco.

I have substantial experience with Python, JavaScript, C++, Swift, and Java coding languages. In addition, many of the tools and libraries that are used with them, such as Flask and React. Please take a look at some of my projects on github! ✌🏼
