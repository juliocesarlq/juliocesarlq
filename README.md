# 👋🏼 Hello! I'm Julio Cesar,
a software and UI/UX developer with 2+ years of experience, a B.S. in Computer Science & Engineering from the University of California, Merced, and an additional 3+ years of CAD and engineering experience.

I've built software tools together with small businesses and big government organizations. Many of the initiatives on which I have worked, from conception to deployment, have involved the development of new ideas. I've created a variety of software tools, including an eye-controlled e-book reader, a native location-based iOS iPhone app, and web applications for organizations like (BART) Bay Area Rapid Transit in San Francisco.

I have substantial experience with Python, JavaScript, C++, Swift, and Java coding languages. In addition, many of the tools and libraries that are used with them, such as Flask and React.
